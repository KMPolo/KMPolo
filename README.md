# Hi, I'm Karen Moreno Polo ðŸ‘‹

**Data-focused oceanographer (M.Sc. candidate) working with large environmental datasets.**

I work with biochemical and physical oceanographic data from the water column to understand how particles move carbon in the ocean. My work is highly data-driven and involves:

- Data cleaning, preprocessing and quality control (QA/QC)
- Organizing large datasets and standardizing variables and units
- Statistical analysis (correlations, regressions, ANOVA, segmented models)
- Scientific visualization (profiles, trends, relationships between variables, time series)

I'm currently interested in:
- Data quality and human evaluation for AI systems
- Annotation and labeling workflows
- Remote work in data-centric and model evaluation roles

## Technical skills
- **Programming:** Python, R, MATLAB
- **Data analysis:** pandas, dplyr, regression models, outlier detection, basic QC pipelines
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, ggplot2, Matlab
- **Documentation:**  scientific reporting, reproducible workflows
- **Languages:** Spanish (native), English (B2)

## Highlight projects
- `ocean-data-cleaning and statical analysis`  
  Basic QA/QC workflow for oceanographic and biogeochemical data (import, cleaning, flagging, export).
- `ocean-biogeochem-visualization`  
  Vertical profiles and chlorophyll / TEP relationships from a Loop Current Eddy in the Gulf of Mexico.
- `ai-annotation-demo`  
  Example of human labeling and consistency checking for text classification tasks (AI training style).
